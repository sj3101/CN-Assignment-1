# Experiment 2 – Bus-like Topology (Hub)

## 🎯 Objective
To implement a hub-based LAN and observe broadcast behavior.

---

## 🛠 Configuration Details
- 1 Hub
- 4 PCs
- IP Range: 192.168.10.1 – 192.168.10.4
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

---

## 🧪 Testing
1. Open `exp2 bus topology.pkt`
2. Use ping command from any PC
3. Observe behavior in Simulation Mode

---

## 📊 Observations
- Hub broadcasts data to all devices.
- All devices receive the packet.
- More traffic compared to switch.
- Lower performance and reliability.
