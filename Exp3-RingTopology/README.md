# Experiment 3 – Ring-like Topology (Switch Loop)

## 🎯 Objective
To create a looped switch topology and test inter-switch communication.

---

## 🛠 Configuration Details
- 3 Switches connected in loop
- PCs connected to each switch
- IP Range: 192.168.10.1 – 192.168.10.4
- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

---

## 🧪 Testing
1. Open `exp3 ring like topology.pkt`
2. Ping across switches
3. Observe packet path in Simulation Mode

---

## 📊 Observations
- Packets travel through multiple switches.
- Provides potential redundancy.
- Loop requires careful configuration.

## 📂 Files Included
- exp3 ring like topology.pkt
- exp3_output.txt
